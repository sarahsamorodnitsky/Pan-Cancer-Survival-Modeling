# Pan-Cancer-Survival-Modeling

This is the repository with code used in the Pan-Cancer Survival Modeling project, titled "A Pan-Cancer and Polygenic Bayesian Hierarchical Model for the Effect of Somatic Mutations on Survival." In this repository, one will find code for (1) data importation and gene set selection, (2) the four models we tried and the calculation of the cross-validated out-of-sample log-posterior likelihoods to compare them, (3) the forward selection procedure we employed, (4) the survival plots we created, and (5) the simulation we used to validate our in-house Gibbs sampler.
